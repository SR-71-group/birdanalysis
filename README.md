The repository consists of two pythong files. 
  audio.py
  main.py

main.py calls the functions from the audio.py file.

audio.py file has 4 functions: open_audio_file, process_folder, create_spectrogram, and plot_signal. 

The example output can be found in the form of image (base_filename.png). Then the function saves the image in the form of NumPy array for post-processing.
