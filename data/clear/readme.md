# download clear dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DKicwtAJTbshE9gtOFIehltaEiGN9Zdz?usp=drive_link)

by clear dataset we mean the raw audio files which were resampled from original dataset 
by extracting bird calls by some automatic techniques and also manual processing of audio samples were it was needed

all files are under 10s long as it is optimal for further usage and saves a lot of computational powers in training process
